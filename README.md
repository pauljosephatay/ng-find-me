# Find Me

Find me allows you to find a user and plot their address on the map.
After selecting a user, the application will display the user's address name and address pet information.

This project has 2 applications under a single workspace. Built using Nrwl Nx.
The first one is an angular application `Ng Find Me` and the other is a react application `Rx Find Me`

Google map api is limited. When quota is reached, it will switch to developer mode. Functionality will still work but watermarks and popup will appear on screen.

# Ng Find Me (Angular)

An over-kill implementation for its use case. Only built as an exercise.
Built using nrwl cli following feature-shell pattern, ngrx for state management and rxjs reactive approach of programming.
