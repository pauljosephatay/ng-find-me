# Find Me

Find me allows you to find a user and plot their address on the map.
After selecting a user, the application will display the user's address name and address pet information.

An over-kill implementation for its use case. Only built as an exercise.
Built using nrwl cli following feature-shell pattern, ngrx for state management and rxjs reactive approach of programming.

Google map api is limited. When quota is reached, it will switch to developer mode. Functionality will still work but watermarks and popup will appear on screen.
